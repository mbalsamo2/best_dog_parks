Specs:

 Use jQuery for implementing new requirements

 Include a show resource rendered using jQuery and an Active Model Serialization JSON backend.
  - show park show page
 Include an index resource rendered using jQuery and an Active Model Serialization JSON backend.
  - On park show page, can render park features show page (am I using AMS here?)
 Include at least one has_many relationship in information rendered via JSON and appended to the DOM.
  - Is this requirement fulfilled through previous requirement? (park has_many features)
 Use your Rails API and a form to create a resource and render the response without a page refresh.
  - Can this be "create new feature" within park show page?
 Translate JSON responses into js model objects.
  - Not sure if this is being done...
 At least one of the js model objects must have at least one method added by your code to the prototype.
  - not sure how to get this to work...
