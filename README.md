Best Dog Parks  
  A dog owner's guide to the best dog parks!

Usage
  - After following the installation steps below, you can create a new account by signing up. Once you have created an account you are free to create a new dog park. Once a park is created, you can create features of the park (agility course, water bowls, benches, etc.). You will be able to view your parks, features, and favorite features (features you gave a 5 star rating to) from the navigation bar at the top of the app. Once you are finished, you are able to log out. You can log back in at any point to view your parks and features, or to add new ones.
